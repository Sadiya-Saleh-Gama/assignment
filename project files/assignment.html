	Based on the enormous amount of press Java is getting and the amount of excitement it has generated, you may get the impression that Java will save the world-or at least solve
	all the problems of the Internet. Not so. Java's hype has run far ahead of its capabilities, and while Java is indeed interesting, it really is another programming language with
	which you write programs that run on the Internet. In this respect, Java is closer to popular programming languages such as C, C++, Visual Basic, or Pascal, than it is to a page description language such as HTML, or a very simple scripting language such as JavaScript or PHP. 
More specifically, Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, a company best known for its high-end UNIX workstations. Modeled after C++, the Java
 language was designed to be small, simple, and portable across platforms and operating systems, both at the source and at the binary level, which means that Java programs (applets and applications) can run on any machine that has the Java virtual machine installed (you'll learn more about this later). 
Java is usually mentioned in the context of the World Wide Web, where browsers such as Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer claim to be "Java enabled." Java enabled
 means that the browser in question can download and play Java programs, called applets, on the reader's system. Applets appear in a Web page much the same way as images do, but 
 unlike images, applets are dynamic and interactive. Applets can be used to create animation, figures, forms that immediately respond to input from the reader, games, or other 
 interactive effects on the same Web pages among the text and graphics.

			To create an applet, you write it in the Java language, compile it using a Java compiler, and refer to that applet in your HTML Web pages. You put the resulting HTML
			and Java files on a Web site in the same way that you make ordinary HTML and image files available. Then, when someone using a Java-enabled browser views your page with
			the embedded applet, that browser downloads the applet to the local system and executes it, allowing your reader to view and interact with your applet in all its glory. (Readers using other browsers that are not Java enabled may see text, a static graphic, or nothing.) 
While applets are probably the most popular use of Java, the important thing to understand about Java is that you can do so much more with it than create and use applets. Java was
 written as a full-fledged general-purpose programming language in which you can accomplish the same sorts of tasks and solve the same sorts of problems that you can in other
 programming languages, such as C or C++.

So far, we have learned about Java programming in very broad terms-what a Java program and an executable look like, 
and how to create simple classes. In this chapter we look at the basics of Java as a programming language.
This chapter covers the following in Java

<p id = "diff" >White space in Java statements, as with C, is unimportant. A statement can be contained on a single line or on multiple lines, and the Java compiler will be able to read it just fine. The most important thing to remember about Java statements is that each one ends with a semicolon (;). 
Forget the semicolon, and your Java program won't compile. Click the dowwnlod button below to download our e-book</p>

		<strong>Poultry farming</strong> is the form of animal husbandry which raises domesticated birds such as chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese to produce
		meat or eggs for food. It has originated from the agricultural era. Poultry - mostly chickens - are farmed in great numbers. 
		More than 60 billion chickens are killed for consumption annually. Chickens raised for eggs are known as layers, while chickens raised for meat are called broilers.
		According to the World Watch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat, and 68 percent of eggs are produced intensively. 
		One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming using lower stocking densities. Poultry producers routinely use nationally approved
		 medications, such as antibiotics, in feed or drinking water, to treat disease or to prevent disease outbreaks. Some FDA-approved medications are also approved
		 for improved feed utilization. Commercial poultry feeding is a highly perfected science that ensures a maximum intake of energy for growth and fat production. 
		 High-quality and well-balanced protein sources produce a maximum amount of muscle, organ, skin, and feather growth. The essential minerals produce bones and eggs, 
		 with about 3 to 4 percent of the live bird being composed of minerals and 10 percent of the egg. Calcium, phosphorus, sodium, chlorine, potassium, sulfur, manganese, 
		 iron, copper, cobalt, magnesium, and zinc are all required. Vitamins A, C, D, E, and K and all of the B vitamins are also required. Antibiotics are widely used to stimulate 
		 appetite, control harmful bacteria, and prevent disease. For chickens, modern rations produce about 0.5 kg (1 pound) of broiler on about 0.9 kg (2 pounds) of feed and a 
		 dozen eggs from 2 kg (4.5 pounds) of feed.

				<strong>Fish farming</strong> or <strong>pisciculture</strong> involves commercial breeding of fish, usually for food, in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds.
				 It is a particular type of aquaculture, which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and so on, 
				 in natural or pseudo-natural environment. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is 
				 generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, catfish, salmon and tilapia. Global demand is 
				 increasing for dietary fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries, resulting in significant decrease in fish stocks and even complete
				  depletion in some regions. Fish farming allows establishment of artificial fish colonies that are provided with sufficient feeding, protection from natural predators and
				   competitive threats, access to veterinarian service, and easier harvesting when needed, while being separate from and thus do not usually impact the sustainable yields 
				   of wild fish populations. While fish farming are practised worldwide, China alone provides 62% of the world's farmed fish production.

Agricultural farming products and equipment concerns all tools and machinery used in horticulture and animal husbandry. A wide variety of equipment and products are required based
on the industries and operations of a particular farm. The agricultural industry has seen a drastic reduction in labor needs in the past century due to mechanization improvements; 
further labor reductions are expected as automation and digitalization yield more efficiencies.
